* Data Manipulation Language (DML)

** Notes

The “M” in DML may refer to
- /Manipulation/, in which case DML incorporates both ~SELECT~ statements
  and modification statements, or
- /Modification/, in which case it excludes ~SELECT~ statements.

** Data Query Language (DQL)

*** Simple queries and their evaluation

Sample query, with clause order evaluation visualed by indentation level:
#+begin_src sql
        SELECT OrderDate, COUNT(OrderID) AS Orders
FROM Sales.SalesOrder
  WHERE Status = 'Shipped'
    GROUP BY OrderDate
      HAVING COUNT(OrderID) > 1
          ORDER BY OrderData DESC;
#+end_src
So, logical evaluation proceeds from the ~FROM~ clause, to ~WHERE~, ~GROUP BY~, ~HAVING~,
~SELECT~ and finally ~ORDER BY~.
